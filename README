# Project README

## Overview:

This project involves setting up a Docker environment for a web application using Nginx.

## Instructions:

### 1. Dockerfile Setup:

- Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
- Create a Dockerfile in your project directory.

### 2. Dockerfile Configuration:

- Use the official Nginx image as the base image by adding the following line to your Dockerfile:

FROM nginx:latest

- Set the working directory inside the container:
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

- Copy HTML files from your local machine to the container:
COPY page1.html page2.html ./

- Install additional packages or dependencies if needed:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package_name

- Expose port 80 to allow incoming traffic:
EXPOSE 80

- Start Nginx server when the container starts:
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


### 3. Building Docker Image:

- Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-nginx-image .

### 4. Running Docker Container:

- Once the image is built, create and run a container using the following command:
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-nginx-container my-nginx-image



### 5. Verification:

- Verify that the container is running by executing:
docker ps

- Access the web application through the browser using http://localhost:80 or your machine's IP address.

## Conclusion:

- This setup will deploy a Nginx web server inside a Docker container, serving HTML files and listening on port 80.

## Additional Tips:

- Customize the HTML files and configurations as needed.
- Ensure correct permissions and file paths in your Dockerfile.
- Test your setup thoroughly before deploying.
